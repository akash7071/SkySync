### Inductor Selection

**Boost Charger Inductor Selection**

The internal control circuitry of the boost charger is engineered to regulate the switching operations, featuring a nominal inductance of **22 µH** with a tolerance of approximately ± 20%.

**Buck Converter Inductor Selection**

The buck converter internal control circuitry is designed to control the switching behavior with a nominal inductance of **10 µH** ± 20%

**VREF_SAMP Capacitance**

The MPPT operation relies on sampled open circuit voltage, and the input regulation is controlled by the voltage stored on the CREF capacitor, which, due to its sensitivity to leakage, should be of the X7R or COG type to maintain proper operation and maximize power extraction from the input source. We have selected **100 pF**
